# [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/)

My body is ready

From https://adventofcode.com/2025/about 

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

Edit: I realized in Day 9 all the puzzles have part 2... I guess I'll revisit once i catched up...

I may (or may not) use a different language for each day:

- Day 1: Swift
- Day 2: Zig
- Day 3: Go
- Day 4: C
- Day 5: Haskell
- Day 6: Rust
- Day 7: Python
- Day 8: Kotlin
- Day 9: JavaScript
